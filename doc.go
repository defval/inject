Package inject make your dependency injection easy. Container allows you to inject dependencies
into constructors or structures without the need to have specified
each argument manually.

Provide dependency

First of all, when creating a new container, you need to describe
how to create each instance of a dependency.To do this, use the container
option inject.Provide(). The first argument in this function is a `provider`.
It determines how to create dependency.

Provider can be a constructor function with optional error:

  	// dependency constructor function
  	func NewDependency(dependency *pkg.AnotherDependency) *pkg.Dependency {
		return &pkg.Dependency{
			dependency: dependency,
		}
	}

  	// and with possible initialization error
  	func NewAnotherDependency() (*pkg.AnotherDependency, error) {
		if dependency, err = initAnotherDependency(); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		return dependency, nil
 	}

	// container initialization code—ã
	container, err := New(
		Provide(NewDependency),
		Provide(NewAnotherDependency)
	)

In this case, the container knows how to create `*pkg.AnotherDependency`
and can handle an instance creation error.

Also, a provider can be a structure pointer with public fields:

	// package pkg
	type Dependency struct {
		AnotherDependency *pkg.AnotherDependency `inject:""`
	}

	// container initialization code
	container, err := New(
		// pointer to structure
		Provide(&pkg.Dependency{}),
		// or structure value
		Provide(pkg.Dependency{})
	)

In this case, the necessity of implementing specific fields are defined
with the tag `inject`.
